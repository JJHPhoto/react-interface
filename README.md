## Application Descrition

This application was created as part of LinkedIn's [Become a React Developer](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/become-a-react-developer) pathway on LinkedIn Learning. I really enjoyed [Ray Villalobos'](https://raybo.org/) clear instructions throught the course. It was also fun to learn more about TailwindCSS. I definitely plan to take Ray's course on that once I finish the other lessons in this pathway.
